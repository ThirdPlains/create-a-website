<h3>Beric Dondarrion</h3>

<p>Beric Dondarrion, the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners! Beric Dondarrion first comes to Kings Landing to fight in the hand's tourney (celebrating the newly appointed hand of the king Eddard Stark) where he loses but decided to remain in Kings landing for a while. While there, Eddard Stark appoints him as the leader of an expedition to find and capture Ser Gregor Clegane to face criminal charges. On his expedition his group is ambushed and he is later presumed dead. Rumors however, start flying around that he is indeed alive and attacking small Lanister parties. When we come across Beric Dondarrion and his group again, it is revealed that he is the leader of the <b>Brotherhood Without Banners,</b>a group opposed to all Lords and houses and swears loyalty to only the Lord of Light. It is also revealed that the Lord of Light has brought Beric Dondarrion back from the dead many times. Later he has a climactic scene where he fights Ser Gregore Clegane only to lose.

<p>Rickon Stark is the youngest Stark child and last male child of Catelynne and Eddard Stark (besides Bran who is crippled) who possibly could be the last heir to Winterfell. When war breaks out and Theon Greyjoy takes over Winterfell keeping Rickon as well as Bran hostage, they escape and run away to prevent Theon's army from killing them. Later Osha (the wildling that was kept in winterfell as hostage but grew fond of the Stark boys) runs away with Rickon to help keep him from harm as Bran makes his way to North of the wall. After being presumed dead, Osha and Rickon are brought to Ramsay Snow-Bolton by the Umbers as a show of fealty to the Bolton army.
